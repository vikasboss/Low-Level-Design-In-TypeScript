Designing a TrueCaller-like system using object-oriented programming in Java would involve creating several classes to represent different aspects of the system. Here is an example of how the classes might be organized:

PhoneNumber class - This class would represent a phone number. It would have properties such as the country code, area code, and the phone number itself. It would also have methods to format the phone number in different ways (e.g. with or without the country code).

Contact class - This class would represent a contact in the TrueCaller system. It would have properties such as the name of the contact, their phone number, and any additional information such as their email address or address. It would also have methods to add or update the contact's information.

PhoneBook class - This class would represent the phone book, and it would have properties such as a list of contacts. It would also have methods to add, remove, and search for contacts in the phone book.

TrueCaller class - This class would be the main class of the system. It would have properties such as the phone book and a list of blocked numbers. It would also have methods to make a call, block a number, and search for a contact in the phone book.
