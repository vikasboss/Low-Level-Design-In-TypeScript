# Low-Level Design in Typescipt

This repository provides examples and exercises for low-level design concepts implemented in TypeScript. It covers various topics related to object-oriented programming, TypeScript, SOLID principles, and design patterns.

## Order of Learning

To get started, it is recommended to follow the learning path outlined below:

1. **TypeScript**: Familiarize yourself with TypeScript, as it is the language used throughout the examples and exercises.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript**: Review the CoderGyan's OOPS in JavaScript course (or any other suitable resource) to understand the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript**: Explore object-oriented programming concepts specifically in TypeScript, as it provides additional features and benefits over plain JavaScript.

4. **SOLID Principles**: Study the SOLID principles - a set of five design principles that help in designing maintainable and flexible software systems.

5. **Design Patterns**: Dive into various design patterns and learn how they can be implemented in Node.js applications. Understand their purposes, advantages, and when to apply them.

Feel free to explore the code examples and exercises provided in this repository as you progress through the learning path. Happy coding!
